* line-height
	The CSS line-height property determines the distance or spacing between the lines of text on the page. In the print world, this property is called leading.
	default is usually 1.2 (multiplier). depends on font-family -- some are "taller" than others
	More pleasant to read at 1.5 to 1.8. Try out those values and/or in between ones.

	Readable widths for text.

* difference between h* sizes/text size
	h1 needs to be *dramatically* bigger than h2. 32px vs 24px defaults? 
	Probably at least double.

	default text size is 16px. So h2 = 32px and h1 = 64px are not terrible values. (and then the other headers would be between 16 and 32px)

* fonts/typefaces
  plain, bold, italic -- uh uh.
  pick one with lot of weights/italics variants
  default weight is 400 -- but 300 is 'book' weight and often nicer to read
  don't overdo it with fonts
  If you use size, weight, slant, and color variations effectively you probably only need one!

* grid
    twitter bootstrap gives you one that collapses nicely on smaller screens for free, other grid systems out there as well
    don't bootstrap a brick wall. consistent layouts. when you break a gutter it should be for a reason. 
    	10/2, 9/3, four 3s or three 4s
    http://pesticide.io/ -- extension for visualizing box model, makes it more obvious when something breaks the grid

    vertical grid: if you use multiples of a given number for all your text, line-heights, images, and margin/padding, it's easy to have vertical harmony as well as a horizontal grid.

* color
	color theory, whatever
	complementary/contrasting colors can be energizing, but too much contrast is disorienting
	and life is anxiety-inducing enough as it is.
	lots of people in our community are colorblind anyway
	***value contrast***
	few things in nature are stark white or stark black -- hip sites'll be #f6f6f6 and #222222 rather than #ffffff and #000000
	monochrome, or mostly monochrome sites look hip and calm and are easy to implement with variables and CSS preprocessors
